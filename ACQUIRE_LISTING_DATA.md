## 6. Competitors

1. **Qurabook**: Main low-cost competitor. Vulnerable due to outdated tech (PHP) and poor UX/UI.
2. **OnCord**: Enterprise focus. Too expensive and complex for small clinics.
3. **Qmatic**: Hardware-heavy (requires kiosks). Expensive legacy solution.

**Our Advantage**: FilaZero is the only "Modern & Light" option—no hardware required (runs on patient's phone), modern UX (React), and offline-first resilience.
